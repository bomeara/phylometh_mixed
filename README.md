To do the exercise, fork this, clone your fork to your computer, make changes to mixed.R, knit it (to create output), `git commit -m"my homework is done" -a` them, `git push`, and then in github make a pull request. See [https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/](this) for how to do this.

Note that this uses the `yearn` package to make this work more easily for teaching (rather than have students hunt down which packages they still need to get, it just loads those they don't have).
